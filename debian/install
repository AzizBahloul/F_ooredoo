# Icons
# We only ship the scalable SVG in the source. Do not list PNGs that are
# not generated during the build — this prevents dh_install missing-files
# failures in chroots. Icon packs or desktop environments can rasterize the
# SVG as needed.

# Man page: install the prewritten man page into the proper directory so
# dh_installman doesn't fail when the chroot can't find it via other lookups.
