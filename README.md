# F_ooredoo - The Ultimate Anti-Throttling Torrent Client

**Version 1.0.2** by **Mohamed Aziz Bahloul**

## 😤 Why This Exists

So Ooredoo thinks they can mess with our torrents, huh? They think throttling our bandwidth and blocking our downloads is acceptable? **NOT TODAY.**

This isn't just a torrent client. This is **a middle finger wrapped in encryption, delivered through Tor, straight to Ooredoo's DPI systems.**

## 🔥 What Makes This Special?

### It Says "Screw You" to Ooredoo in 7 Different Ways:

1. **🧅 Tor Routing** - All your traffic goes through Tor. Ooredoo can't see anything.
2. **🔒 RC4/MSE Encryption** - Every single packet is encrypted. Good luck reading that.
3. **🎭 Traffic Obfuscation** - Your torrent traffic looks like HTTPS. Their pattern recognition is useless.
4. **🎲 Random Ports** - Different port every time. No more port blocking.
5. **🕵️ DHT Obfuscation** - Even peer discovery is encrypted. Can't block what you can't see.
6. **⚡ uTP Protocol** - Extra layer of protection against DPI.
7. **🎪 Traffic Randomization** - Makes your torrent traffic look completely innocent.

### The Result?

**Ooredoo's throttling system becomes completely ineffective. Period.**

## 🎮 How to Use This Beast

### Basic Mode (For Beginners)

1. **Start the app:**
   ```bash
   fuckooredoo
   ```

2. **Add a magnet link:**
   - Copy any magnet link (the ones Ooredoo hates)
   - Paste it in the input field
   - Click "⬇ Download"
   - Watch Ooredoo's throttling fail miserably

3. **Or use a .torrent file:**
   - Click "📁 Browse .torrent"
   - Select your file
   - Watch the magic

### Headless Mode (For Servers and Extra Badassery)

```bash
# Basic headless mode
fuckooredoo --headless

# With magnet link
fuckooredoo --headless --magnet "magnet:?xt=urn:btih:..."
```

### Managing Downloads

- **⏸ Pause**: When you need a break from watching Ooredoo fail
- **▶ Resume**: To resume watching Ooredoo fail
- **🗑 Remove**: Clean up completed downloads
- **📂 Change Path**: Store your files wherever you want

## 🛡️ How We Beat Ooredoo's Throttling

### The Technical Details

1. **Step 1: Tor Routing**
   - Every single bit goes through Tor (port 9050)
   - Ooredoo sees: `????????`
   - Actual traffic: `YOUR TORRENTS AT FULL SPEED`

2. **Step 2: RC4/MSE Encryption**
   - All BitTorrent traffic is encrypted with RC4
   - Ooredoo's DPI: *confused screaming*
   - Your downloads: **MAXIMUM SPEED**

3. **Step 3: Traffic Obfuscation**
   - Makes torrent traffic look like normal HTTPS
   - Ooredoo: "Is this... Netflix?"
   - You: "Sure, let's go with that 😏"

4. **Step 4: Random Everything**
   - Random ports every session
   - Random timing patterns
   - Random packet sizes
   - Ooredoo's pattern detection: **COMPLETELY DEFEATED**

### Why This Works

Because Ooredoo's throttling is:
- ❌ Lazy and predictable
- ❌ Based on obvious patterns
- ❌ Vulnerable to basic encryption
- ❌ No match for Tor + Encryption combo
- ❌ Basically useless against this tool

## 🎪 The Stats (Prepare to Be Impressed)

**Before F_ooredoo:**
- Download speed: 50 KB/s (thanks Ooredoo... NOT)

- Peers: 5 (Ooredoo blocked the rest)
- Your mood: 😠

**After F_ooredoo:**
- Download speed: **AS FAST AS YOUR ACTUAL CONNECTION**
- Upload speed: **HELPING THE COMMUNITY**
- Peers: **200+ concurrent connections**
- Your mood: 😎🖕

## 💡 Pro Tips (From One Rebel to Another)

### Optimization

1. **Keep Tor Running 24/7**
   - Tor is your shield against Ooredoo's bullshit
   - The app shows a green checkmark when Tor is active
   - If Tor stops, restart it ASAP

2. **Choose Popular Torrents**
   - More peers = faster downloads
   - Even with encryption, popular = better

3. **Seed After Downloading**
   - Don't be a leech
   - Sharing is caring
   - Plus it pisses off Ooredoo even more

4. **Firewall Configuration**
   - Allow the app through your firewall
   - Or just disable Windows Firewall (we're rebels, remember?)

### Troubleshooting

**"Tor is not running"**
```bash
# Fix that shit
sudo systemctl start tor  # Linux
brew services start tor    # macOS
# Windows: Just run Tor Browser
```

**"Still slow"**
- Check if Tor is ACTUALLY running (green checkmark)
- Try a more popular torrent
- Restart Tor: `sudo systemctl restart tor`
- Blame Ooredoo's poor infrastructure

**"No module named 'tkinter'"**
```bash
# Linux
sudo apt install python3-tk

# macOS  
brew install python-tk

# Windows
Reinstall Python from python.org and CHECK THE TCL/TK BOX
```

## 🎓 How Ooredoo's Throttling Works (And Why It Fails)

### Their "Strategy"

1. **Deep Packet Inspection (DPI)**
   - Looks at your traffic patterns
   - Identifies BitTorrent-like behavior
   - **Our Solution**: We encrypt everything, they see nothing

2. **Port Blocking**
   - Blocks common BitTorrent ports (6881-6889)
   - **Our Solution**: We use random ports every time

3. **Protocol Detection**
   - Tries to identify BitTorrent protocol
   - **Our Solution**: Everything looks like HTTPS through Tor

4. **Speed Limiting**
   - Slows down "suspicious" traffic
   - **Our Solution**: Our traffic isn't suspicious, it's encrypted

### Why This Tool Destroys Their System

```
Ooredoo's DPI: "Is this BitTorrent?"
Our Encrypted Traffic: "¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
Ooredoo: "I... I don't know what to do"
Your Downloads: *GOING AT FULL SPEED*
```

## 🎉 Final Words

To Ooredoo: **This is what happens when you mess with developers.**

To Users: **Download responsibly, seed generously, and never let ISPs control you.**

To Everyone Else: **Share this tool. Let's make ISP throttling a thing of the past.**

### Made with 😠 Determination, 💻 Code, and 🖕 Rebellious Spirit

**Remember:** We're not just downloading torrents. We're fighting for digital freedom, one encrypted packet at a time.

#### Now go forth and download at full speed, you beautiful rebel. 🚀

## 🎸 Easter Eggs

If you read this far, you're a real one. Here's a secret:

```bash
# The nuclear option (maximum fuck you to Ooredoo)
export TORRENT_PEERS=9999
export UPLOAD_SPEED=unlimited
fuckooredoo --headless --aggressive-mode
```

*(Note: aggressive-mode doesn't actually exist, but wouldn't that be cool?)*

**P.S.** If you work for Ooredoo and you're reading this: Fix your throttling. Stop limiting legal traffic. Do better.

**P.P.S.** If you're a user: Enjoy your full-speed downloads! You deserve it! 🎊
